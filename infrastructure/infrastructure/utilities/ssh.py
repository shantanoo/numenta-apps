Helper methods for running commands remotely.

This is not in utilities.ec2 for two reasons:

1. It doesn't only work on ec2 instances

2. If you put it in utilities.ec2, when it gets imported from utilities.salt
(which is imported from utilities.ec2 because launchNumentaInstance needs
 requestKeySignature) that causes an import loop and raises an exception.
