# Helper script for the taurus service

# We need to run the taurus service as ec2-user, but using su to switch users
# makes us lose our environment settings. This helper script is called by the
# taurus-server init script, loads the necessary environment and
# starts supervisord.

# TODO: figure out a cleaner solution to avoid this extra layer. TAUR-655
