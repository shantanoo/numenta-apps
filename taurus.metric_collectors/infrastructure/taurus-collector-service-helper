# Helper script for Taurus supervisor

# We need to run Taurus server as ec2-user, but using su to switch users
# makes us lose our environment settings. This helper script will be
# called by the collector init script, load the necessary environment and
# start supervisord.

# TODO: figure out a cleaner solution to avoid this extra layer. TAUR-655
